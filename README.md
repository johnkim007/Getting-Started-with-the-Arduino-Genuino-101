The Arduino/Genuino 101 is a learning and development board which contains the Intel® Curie™ Module, 
designed to integrate the core's low power-consumption and high performance with the Arduino's ease-of-use. 

The 101 adds Bluetooth Low Energy capabilities and has an on-board 6-axis accelerometer/gyroscope, 
providing exciting opportunities for building creative projects in the connected world. 

More information about the technical specifications and documentation can be found on the Arduino/Genuino 101 main page.

The Arduino/Genuino 101 is programmed using the Arduino Software (IDE), 
our Integrated Development Environment common to all our boards and running both online and offline.
